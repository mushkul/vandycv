## Project Overview

VandyCV is a web-based software application designed to help Vanderbilt University students create personalized resumes tailored to their academic majors and career goals. With the integration of customizable templates and AI-assisted content generation, VandyCV streamlines the resume creation process, allowing students to present their qualifications effectively to potential employers or graduate programs.

## Problem Statement

Many students struggle with creating resumes that highlight their skills and experiences in a way that is industry-specific or tailored to the requirements of different academic majors. Generic resume templates often fail to adequately showcase a studentâ€™s qualifications, leading to less impactful applications.
